1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
One of these things #
2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following.
What are the outputs?
b/a                 =2.5
b//a                =2
b**a                =25
b%a                 =1
a+B                 =results in an error because B is not defined, however a+b =7
type(42)            =class 'int'
type(42.0)          =class 'float'
type("C3PO")        =class 'str'
type(True)          =class 'bool'
3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?
a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a             =15.0     #changed 15 to 15.0
type(a)       =class 'float'
4.) Fix the mistake in the following code.
x,y=(4,5)
a=3*(x + y)    #Parenthisis does not automatically multiply
a
#a would be 27
5.) Fix the code so it will calculate the average.
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave=(x+y+z)/3
ave
#ave would be 4.0
