1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
you put the hashtag sign before your comment ex: #this is the comment


2.) Enter a=2 and b=5 in the Python Console window and then all of the following.
What are the outputs?


b/a                 = 2.5
b//a                = 2 #floor : cuts off everything after the decimal
b**a                = 25
b%a                 = 1 # modulus : oit gives you the remainder
a+B                 = 7
type(42)            = 42
type(42.0)          = 42.0
type("C3PO")        = 'C3PO'
type(True)          = True


3.) What is the final output of (a) and type(a) if you enter the following 5 lines
into the Python Console Window?


a=2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7

a             = 15.0
type(a)       = float


4.) Fix the mistake in the following code.
x,y = (4,5)
a = 3 * (x + y)
a = 27


5.) Fix the code so it will calculate the average.
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = (x+y+z)/3
ave = 4
