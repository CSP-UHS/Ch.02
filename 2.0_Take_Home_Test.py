HONOR CODE: I solemnly promise that while taking this test I will only use PyCharm or the Internet,
but I will definitely not ask another person except the instructor. Typed: Jackson M. Rutto

1.) How do you enter a single line comment in a program?
Use a #hashtag



2.) What do the following lines of code output? ALSO: Why do they give a different answer?
2 / 3 = 0.6666
- Divide by three
2 // 3 = 0
- Floor the number
3/2 = 1.5
- Divide by two
3//2 = 1
-Floor the number




3.) What happens when you try this and why?
A = 22
b = 13
c = a+b = 35
- This happens because a and b are now set variables






4.) All of the variable names below can be used. But which ONE of these is the better variable name to use?
a - This one
A
Area
AREA
area
area_of_rectangle
Area_Of_Rectangle





5.) Which of these variables names are NOT allowed in Python? 
Test them if you aren't sure.

apple - yes
Apple - yes
APPLE - yes
Apple2 - yes
1Apple - no
account number - no
account_number - yes
account.number - no
accountNumber - yes
account# - no
pi - yes
PI - yes
fred - yes
Fred - yes
GreatBigVariable - yes
greatBigVariable - yes
great_big_variable - yes
great.big.variable - no
2x - no
x2x - yes
total% - no
#left - no





6.) Predict the output of (a) and its type and then test it?
a =2
a*=10
a/=2
a+=12
a-=7
a
type(a)

a = {float} 15





7.) This program runs, but the code still could be better. How?
radius = 10
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi  * radius ** 2
area

Change to:
r = 10
pi = 3.14
a = pi
a = pi * r ** 2
a



8.) What is the ouput of each of these?
type(42) - int
type(42.0) - float
type("C3PO") - str
type(True) - bool







9.) Fix the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y) - Change this part to: a = 3 * (x + y)
a






10.)Why does this code not calculate the average?
x,y,z =(3,4,5)
ave = x+y+z/3
ave
- Because it is using PEMDAS and is dividing z by 3 first then adding x and y
